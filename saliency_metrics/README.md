# saliency_metrics


Metrics for comparing two salience maps or two fixation maps. These metrics are implemented in matlab here https://github.com/cvzoya/saliency/tree/master/code_forMetrics . This is just a reimplementation of the metrics in python. 
The salience benchmark (in matlab) and this code produce the same measures for the same set of inputs. 


Metrics implemented are ->
1. AUC Judd
2. AUC Borji
3. AUC shuffled
4. NSS
5. Info Gain
6. SIM 
7. CC
8. KL divergence

The two maps to be compared are gt and s_map. Each method also discretizes (if needed) and normalizes the maps. Details about each 
of the methods can be found in the MIT Salience Benchmark paper (What do different evaluation metrics tell us about saliency models?)
